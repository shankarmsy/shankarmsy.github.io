##Nikola Static Site deployed on Github Pages

Nikola is an awesome, static site generator written 100% in Python and makes creating your own (or even your Company's) website a breeze. Furthermore if deployed on Github pages, it gives you an enviable freedom and control to set everything up to your taste, for **free**.

As an added bonus, if you love IPython, it integrates seamlessly with Nikola letting you almost blog directly from an IPython notebook. Plus its entirely customizable by easy tweaks to Python code.

**This repo is my personal website/blog deployed on Nikola and Github.**
