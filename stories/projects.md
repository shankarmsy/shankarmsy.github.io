Below is a collection of all my Data Science related work. It includes mostly IPython notebooks but contains code from multiple languages/packages and spanning mostly Data Science topics such as:  

- Data Munging
- Data Analysis & Exploration
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualizations  

I needed a central location to display all the work I've done to both learn and demonstrate my Data Science skills, so here it is. But I intend to extend this to other areas as well such as my fun projects and tidbits of other things that fascinate me.  

Feel free to use any of this for your own reference but expect more code than text. Although I try to make it descriptive these aren't intended to be tutorials.  


**Data Science Mini-Projects**  
I call these mini projects because they cover the full spectrum of the learning process beginning with Data Munging, Data Analysis, Data Exploration in the form of visualizations before actually getting into model fitting, cross validation and model evaluation. They initially began as an attempt to learn individual algorithms but I realized that I can get the best value only if I undertake the complete Data Science process to understand the true meaning of successful model development. I intend to host solutions in multiple toolsets here but I will start with scikit-learn (+ other python packages) and R.

**Kaggle Competitions**  
Following are some of the competitions I've participated in at Kaggle. For each item below, I've documented my entire approach that includes:

- Data Analysis through Visualizations  
- Data Munging  
- Feature Normalization
- Feature Engineering
- Model Fitting & Evaluation with multiple classifiers/regressors
- Model Comparison  

[Saving the Titanic with R & IPython](/posts/saving-titanic-r.html)  
In this session I work on the Titanic Survival prediction challenge. The solution is entirely in **R** but hosted in an IPython notebook.

[Predicting Forest Cover Types with Ensemble Learning](/posts/forest-cover-types.html)  
In this session I work on the Forest Cover Type prediction challenge. The solution is entirely in Python. I try to demonstrate the ensemble approach to machine learning with this competition (with reasonable success).

**Data Munging - Getting & Cleaning Data**  
These are tool-focused working sessions. The focus here is to understand the concepts of Data Munging from the perspective of the tool at hand. I intend to initially start with Pandas but will expand to other areas as well. I also attempted Data Cleansing with R as part of the Titanic Survival prediction project.
