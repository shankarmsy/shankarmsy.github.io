Thank you for visiting my site. I am **Shankar Muthuswamy**, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. This blog is basically a collection of my ramblings as I work my way into the deep horizons of data science. But the topics won't be restricted to data science, I intend to blog about anything technical that excites me. 

>***From my own experience, I've always learned things better and faster when I tried to teach it to someone.   
So that in essence is the mission statement for this site*** 

Comments are most welcome. I appreciate constructive feedback in any form or shape and take expert rebuttals on the chin.

Cheers!  
Shankar
