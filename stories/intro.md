Thanks for visiting. I am **Shankar Muthuswamy**, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. The aim of this blog is to serve as a journal for my ideas, experiments and projects as I pursue a career in data science.    

I've not chosen these topics for any specific reason other than to learn something new and I am not sure of their scientific value but sharing with the hope that someone somewhere finds it useful. The topics won't be restricted to data science though, I intend to blog about anything technical that excites me in this journey.    

Comments are most welcome. 

**Share More, Learn More!**  
Shankar
