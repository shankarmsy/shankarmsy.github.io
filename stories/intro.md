Thank you for visiting my site. I am Shankar Muthuswamy, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. This blog is basically a collection of my ramblings as I work my way into the deep horizons of data science. From my own experience, I've always learned things better and faster when I tried to teach it to someone. So that in essence is what I intend to do with this blog. 

Comments are most welcome. I appreciate constructive feedback in any form or shape and take expert rebuttals on the chin.
