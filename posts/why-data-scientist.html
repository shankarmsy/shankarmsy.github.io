<p>I just wrote about my thoughts on why I would love to become a Data Scientist in my <a href="https://shankarmsy.github.io/stories/background.html">Background</a> page and thought I'll share it as a post as well.</p>
<p>There might be something there that will benefit those considering a transition to Data Science. I would also be thrilled to receive any feedback/comments.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Glad you'd like to know more about me. Here comes the preamble :-)<br>
<br>
For over 12 years, I built a fairly successful consulting career in <strong>Business Intelligence</strong>, mostly SAP BusinessObjects but with other BI tools as well such as Tableau. During this time, I had the wonderful opportunity to provide services to many of the major Fortune500 companies. When you're constantly learning something new, there is never a dearth of excitement. That pretty much sums up this phase of my professional career.</p>
<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p>In Machine Learning, there's a concept of learning curves.  If you look at a high bias or high variance curve, both training and test errors flatten after several iterations.  Depending on how close the curves are to each other when they flatten, we can tell if it's a high variance or a high bias problem. I think life teaches us a similar lesson in some aspects. Doing the same thing over and over again, flattens our learning curve at some point. We have to throw in some surprises to keep ourselves motivated. </p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShankarMsy/shankarmsy.github.io/source/galleries/Inserts/lc-hb.png" title="Typical High Variance problem in ML, source Prof. Andrew Ng">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Getting more of the same thing will just not help, the similarity is striking :-)</em>  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am digressing, but you must see the point I am trying hard to make. Though great while it lasted, my learning curve with Business Intelligence totally flattened out hence prompting me to look at other avenues to keep myself motivated. Not saying there is nothing I don't know about BI, but I just kept losing the motivation to keep treading the same path.</p>
<h3>Why Data Science?</h3>
<p>The more I read about Data Science, the more I was drawn to it. I also however realized I was late to the party. Though everyone is talking about it for the last year or so, the field has been around for a while, in various forms and shapes. I decided that my next ambition in life is to be a data scientist due to the following reasons:  </p>
<p><strong>Array of skills you need to be successful</strong></p>
<p>This is the factor that both lured me the most as well as scared me the most. Sample this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Math, Probability &amp; Statistics fundamentals (and that's saying a lot in one line for some of us)</li>
<li>Programming skills &amp; languages (you need to have affinity for coding) </li>
<li>Data Analysis &amp; Preparation (the heart of Data Science)</li>
<li>Machine Learning (the building blocks)</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Presentation &amp; Articulating results - You basically need to be a         Data-driven Journalist but you'll need to do much more than just        talking.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I realized that I have a general desire and curiosity to learn more about all these topics. Machine Learning in particular had an appeal to it that made me crave to learn something in a very long time (or perhaps for the first time).</p>
<p><strong>Oh! the immense potential</strong>  </p>
<p>There's data everywhere these days. Anything and everything that we touch spits out data at a rate faster than light. Imagine if you have all the skills to take an enormous mountain of raw numbers &amp; text and tell a story with it. Not just some story, but one that will benefit not just you and your Organization but countless others who don't even know you. For instance, cancer research, automated-car driving, Netflix movie recommendations, the list goes on for ML applications.</p>
<p><strong>The Scientist in me :-)</strong>  </p>
<p>Some people don't like the term Data Scientist, I for one love it. Common, this is my one and only opportunity in this lifetime to have a scientist in my job title. Jokes apart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Any skill(s) that can take raw "anything" and derive meaning out of it is Science in my book. When that raw anything is data, it is Data Science. I totally buy it and that eggs me on even more to become a Data Scientist.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My Background</strong>  </p>
<p>Although many of the areas I needed to learn or in fact will blog about is new to me, I think BI is a pretty good skill to have and will positively influence a data science career. Understanding SQL, Data Visualization (to an extent), Data Munging (through exposure to ETL) and some programming skills (although not with Python or R) sure doesn't hurt if not help. </p>
<p>So I decided to dive in and dedicate myself 100% to Data Science. The quest is still on as we speak and this blog is my means of learning, sharing, communicating as well as demonstrating my progress in Data Science. Hopefully someone with special powers will take notice :=)</p>
<h3>So What Now?</h3>
<p>My game plan and daily routine these days is essentially  the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning, learning and more learning</strong>  </p>
<p>How do I learn? I am a strong believer in teaching myself. In this day and age, with the amount of help that's available on the internet, anyone can learn just about anything, on their own. And I do not have the time to go back to school. I will rather invest the time in furthering skills myself. If you're wondering what I am rambling about, this basically means <code>MOOCs on a countably infinite loop</code></p>
<p>This is not just restricted to Data Science. I am interested in front-end development, Linux and other topics such as for instance, Nikola. As I continue blogging, I will share some great links on all relevant topics I post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-world Projects</strong>  </p>
<p>I am fasicinated by the idea of working on real-world projects and will be starting to work on a few ideas shortly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sharing &amp; more Learning, through Blogging</strong>  </p>
<p>Teaching and sharing what I've learnt and know, thereby enabling further learning, both for myself and others reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For when I am Ready</strong>  </p>
<p>That day when I start to look out for interesting assignments in Data Science. I'll worry about that when I am ready. For now, <em>I need to get better</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you found atleast some of this article interesting. I will be excited to hear you comments and feedback about my mode of preparation and wish you the best in whatever you do!</p>
<p>Happy Reading!
