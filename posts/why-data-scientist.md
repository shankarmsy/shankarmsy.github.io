After having completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering, I was drawn to the deep waters of IT and then onto the even deeper chasm of Consulting. For over 12 years I did consulting work in Business Intelligence and did it fairly well to make a career out of it. I had the opportunity to travel, work and meet great interesting people and more importantly had a good learning curve.

Learning is key because it instills hope.<!-- TEASER_END --> That there is something to look forward to each day. When that learning curve flattens, you begin noticing the side effects. You lose motivation, complain about work more and it becomes purely a way to pay the bills. A lot of us dread this scenario. When I chanced upon Data Science. I didn't quite realize at the time that it would give me a chance to rediscover myself technically and encourage a mid-career shift.

###Why Data Science?

I started reading about Data Science not too long ago. The more I read about it, the more I was drawn to it. I also however realized that though everyone is talking about it for the last year or so, the field has been around for a while, *in various forms and shapes*. When I think of the reasons why I found it attractive, a few spring to mind:

**My Background**  

Although many of the areas I needed to learn or in fact will blog about is new to me, I think having good BI/ETL skills will positively influence a data science career. Understanding SQL, Data Visualization, Data Munging (through exposure to ETL) and some programming skills sure helps.  And this was crucial since I could put to use some of the good skills I gained with my BI Consulting stint.

**Array of skills you need to be successful**
		
This is the factor that both surprised as well as lured me the most. Being a Data Scientist is not a matte of learning Python or R but it takes a gamut of skills and experience. To list a few:

1. Math, Probability & Statistics fundamentals 
2. Programming skills & languages (you need to have affinity for coding) 
3. Data Analysis & Preparation (the heart of Data Science)
4. Machine Learning (the building blocks)
5. Data Visualization
6. Presentation & Articulating results - You basically need to be a 		Data-driven Journalist but you'll need to do much more than just 		talking.  

One needs to have a general desire and curiosity to learn more about all these topics. Machine Learning in particular had an appeal to it that made me crave to learn something new in a very long time.

**The immense potential**  

There's data everywhere these days. Anything and everything that we touch spits out data at a rate faster than light. Imagine if you have all the skills to take an enormous mountain of raw numbers & text and tell a story with it. Not just some story but one that could touch the lives of others. For instance, cancer research, automated-car driving, Netflix movie recommendations, the list goes on.

**The Scientist in me**  

Some people don't like the term Data Scientist, I for one love it. Apart form the pleasure of having Scientist in my job title, I believe any skill that can take raw "anything" and derive meaning out of it is Science. When that raw anything is data, it is Data Science. I totally buy it.

Above all, it fit the bill perfectly in terms of whetting my creative and professional appetite. It was new to me, exciting, builds on fundamental Math and CompSci, and I needed to learn and improve quite a bit.  

So I decided to dive in and dedicate time & effort to becoming a Data Scientist. The quest is still on and this blog is my means of journaling and demonstrating my progress. 

Hope some of this inspires you in your own intellectual quest!

Happy Reading!
