<p>Thank you for visiting my site. I am <strong>Shankar Muthuswamy</strong>, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. This blog is basically a collection of my ramblings as I work my way into the deep horizons of data science. But the topics won't be restricted to data science, I intend to blog about anything technical that excites me. </p>
