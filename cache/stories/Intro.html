<p>Thanks for visiting. I am <strong>Shankar Muthuswamy</strong>, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. The aim of this blog is to serve as a journal for my ideas, experiments and projects as I work my way into the deep horizons of data science.  I've not chosen these topics for any specific reason other than to learn something new and I am not sure of their scientific value but sharing with the hope that someone somewhere finds it useful. The topics won't be restricted to data science, I intend to blog about anything technical that excites me in this journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>From my own experience, I've always learned things better and faster when I tried to teach it to someone. <br />
So that in essence is the mission statement for this blog</em></strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comments are most welcome. Word of caution, I do not have a PhD or a Masters and learn much of this on my own so if you're an expert tell me what I can/should change and why. I appreciate constructive feedback in any form or shape and take expert rebuttals on the chin.</p>
<p>If you have the luxury of time click <a href="/stories/background.html">here</a> to learn more about my background and hear why I chose Data Science. Otherwise, Happy reading!</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />
Shankar</p>
