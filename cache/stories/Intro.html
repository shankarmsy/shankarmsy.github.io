<p>Thanks for visiting. I am <strong>Shankar Muthuswamy</strong>, an aspiring Data Scientist, avid technology enthusiast and a father. The aim of this blog is to serve as a journal for my ideas, experiments and projects as I pursue a career in data science.    </p>
<p>I've not chosen these topics for any specific reason other than to learn something new and I am not sure of their scientific value but sharing with the hope that someone somewhere finds it useful. The topics won't be restricted to data science though, I intend to blog about anything technical that excites me in this journey.    </p>
<p>Comments are most welcome. Click <a href="/stories/background.html">here</a> to learn more about my background.</p>
