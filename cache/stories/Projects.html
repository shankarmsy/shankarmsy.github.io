<p>Below is a collection of all my Data Science related work. It includes mostly IPython notebooks but contains code from multiple languages/packages and spanning mostly Data Science topics such as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Data Munging</li>
<li>Data Analysis &amp; Exploration</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Data Visualizations  </li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to use any of this for your own reference but expect more code than text!  </p>
<h3>Real-world Data Science</h3>
<p>These are some of my attempts at creating (and solving) real-world scenarios for Data Science. I will publish the full source code and other artifacts here once the individual projects are complete.  </p>
<p><strong>Predicting Restaurant Health Scores using Yelp User Reviews and SF Open Data</strong><br />
City Health Inspectors provide a health score for each restaurant they visit. They also lodge their complaints if any and request the owners to correct the issues. Once the issues have been corrected, the restaurants are eligible to receive a score. Knowing the popularity of Yelp and being a Yelper myself, this project is basically an attempt to see if user reviews or Yelp restaurant details like the location, neighborhood, price etc. can give us an indication of the potential Health Score. Perhaps some users talked about how unclean a restaurant was or in some neighborhoods, things are always spic and span. </p>
<h3>Mini-Projects</h3>
<p>I call these mini-projects since they are based on common scenarios/applications of Machine Learning. But they do cover the full spectrum of the learning process beginning with Data procurement to Model Comparison &amp; Visualization and are based on real data sets (open data). I intend to host solutions in multiple toolsets here but I will start with scikit-learn (+ other python packages) and R.  </p>

<h3>Kaggle Competitions</h3>
<p>Following are some of the competitions I've participated in at <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. Where possible, I've also documented my entire approach as IPython notebooks.</p>
<p>Currently participating in (will upload solutions once done):  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction">Predicting Click-through-Rate for Avazu</a>  </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Past Competitions</strong></p>
<p><a href="/posts/saving-titanic-r.html">Saving the Titanic with R &amp; IPython</a><br />
In this session I work on the Titanic Survival prediction challenge. The solution is entirely in <strong>R</strong> but is hosted in an IPython notebook. It should also serve as a good starter code since it explains multiple models and compares results.</p>
<p><a href="/posts/forest-cover-types.html">Predicting Forest Cover Types with Ensemble Learning</a><br />
In this session I work on the Forest Cover Type prediction challenge. The solution is entirely in Python. I try to demonstrate the ensemble approach to machine learning with this competition (with reasonable success).</p>
<h3>Tool-focused sessions</h3>
<p>The focus here is to understand the concepts given the tool at hand. I've illustrated Data Munging with Pandas below. I intend to attempt and compare multiple tools, for instance I attempted Data Cleansing with R as part of the <a href="/posts/saving-titanic-r.html">Titanic Survival prediction</a> project.  </p>
