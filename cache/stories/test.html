<p>Glad you'd like to know more about me. Here comes the preamble :=)</p>
<p>For over 12 years, I built a fairly successful consulting career in
<strong>Business Intelligence</strong>, mostly SAP BusinessObjects but with other BI
tools as well such as Tableau. During this time, I had the wonderful
opportunity to provide services to some of the major Fortune500
companies including <strong>Warner Bros</strong>, <strong>Levi Strauss</strong>, <strong>HJ Heinz</strong>,
<strong>Nike</strong> and <strong>Sony Pictures</strong>. When you're constantly learning
something new, there is never a dearth of excitement. That pretty much
sums up this phase of my professional career.</p>

<h1>Learning Curve</h1>
<p>In Machine Learning, there's a concept of learning curves as <strong>Prof.
Andrew Ng</strong> so beautifully illustrates
<a class="reference external" href="http://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/ML-advice.pdf">here</a>. If
you notice a high bias or high variance curve, both training and test
errors flatten after several iterations. Depending on how close the
curves are to each other when they flatten, we can tell if it's a high
variance or a high bias problem. I think life teaches us a similar
lesson in some aspects. Doing the same thing over and over again,
flattens our learning curve at some point. We have to throw in some
surprises to keep ourselves motivated.</p>
<p><em>Getting more of the same thing will just not help, the similarity is
striking :-)</em></p>

<p>I am digressing, but you must see the point I am trying hard to make.
Though great while it lasted, my learning curve with Business
Intelligence totally flattened out hence prompting me to look at other
avenues to keep myself motivated. Not saying there is nothing I don't
know about BI, but I just kept losing the motivation to keep treading
the same path.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-data-science">
<h1>Why Data Science?</h1>
<p>The more I read about Data Science, the more I was drawn to it. I
realized I was late to the party. Though everyone is talking about it
for the last year or so, the field has been around for a while, in
various forms and shapes. I decided that my next ambition in life is to
be a data scientist due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Array of skills you need to be successful</strong></p>
<p>This is the factor that both lured me the most as well as scared me
the most. Sample this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Math, Probability &amp; Statistics fundamentals (and that's saying a
lot in one line for some of us)</li>
<li>Programming skills &amp; languages (you need to have affinity for
coding)</li>
<li>Data Analysis &amp; Preparation (the heart of Data Science)</li>
<li>Machine Learning (the building blocks)</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Presentation &amp; Articulating results - You basically need to be a
Data-driven Journalist but you'll need to do much more than just
talking.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Oh! the immense potential</strong> There's data everywhere these days.
Anything and everything that we use spits out data at a rate faster
than light. Imagine if you have all the skills to take an enormous
mountain of numbers &amp; text and tell a story with it. Not just some
story, but one that will benefit not just you and your Organization
but countless others who don't know you. For instance, cancer
research, automated-car driving, Netflix movie recommendations, the
list goes on for ML applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The Scientist in me :=)</strong> Some people don't like the term Data
Scientist, I for one love it. Common, this is my one and only
opportunity in this lifetime to have a scientist in my job title.
Jokes apart,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I think that a skill that can take raw &quot;anything&quot; and derives
meaning out of it is Science. When that raw anything is data, it is
Data Science. I totally buy it and that eggs me on even more to
become a Data Scientist.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>My Background</strong> Although many of the areas I needed to learn or in
fact will blog about is new to me, I think BI is a pretty good skill
to have and will positively influence a data science career.
Understanding SQL, Data Visualization (to an extent), Data Munging
(through exposure to ETL) and some programming skills (although not
with Pyhon or R) sure doesn't hurt if not help.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to dive in, very recently full-time, by quitting my job
(lets see how that pans out) and dedicating myself 100% to Data Science.
This blog is my means of learning, sharing, communicating as well as
demonstrating my progress in Data Science. Hopefully someone with
special powers will take notice :=)</p>

<div class="section" id="so-what-now">
<h1>So What Now?</h1>
<p>My days now consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Learning, learning and more learning</strong> How do I learn? I am a
strong believer in teaching myself. In this day and age, with the
amount of help that's available on the internet, anyone can learn
just about anything, on their own. And no, I am not going to invest
in a Masters or PhD, I will rather invest the time in furthering
skills myself. If you're wondering what I am rambling about, this
basically means <tt class="docutils literal">MOOCs on a countably infinite loop</tt></p>
<p>This is not just restricted to Data Science. I am interested in
front-end development, Linux and other topics such as for instance,
Nikola. As I continue blogging, I will share some great links on all
relevant topics I post.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Real-world Projects</strong> I am fasicinated by the idea of working on
real-world projects and will be starting to work on a few ideas
shortly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Sharing &amp; more Learning, through Blogging</strong> Teaching and sharing
what I've leant and know there by enabling further learning, both for
myself and others reading.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>For when I am Ready</strong> That day when I start to look out for
interesting assignments in Data Science. For now, I need to get
better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you found atleast some of this article interesting. I will be
excited to hear you comments and feedback about my mode of preparation
and wish you the best in whatever you do!</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
