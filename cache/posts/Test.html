<p>So glad to finally be writing my first post with [<strong>Nikola</strong>](<a class="reference external" href="https://www.getnikola.com">https://www.getnikola.com</a>). It truly provides an awesome, fun way of setting up a static website/blog and gives you complete control every step of the way. It took me a while to get this setup working but boy am I pleased with the results. It's written completely in Python, is blazingly fast, features an <strong>IPython</strong> plugin that lets you create and share IPython content directly and deploys easily to <strong>Github</strong>, giving you version control for your blog. Everything is 100% customizable and to top it off, is completely free. <em>Can it get any better?</em></p>
<p>So without further ado, below I will attempt explain the steps I followed to successfully set up a site with Nikola, configure the IPython plugin for Nikola and setup a Github page to deploy the website. Before I begin, a quick disclaimer. These are steps that worked well for me and I hope will help you too but if you're looking for a tutorial, I suggest you learn like I did, from the pros instead.</p>
<p>Let's get started.
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;</p>
<p>##So What is Nikola?
Nikola is a python-based static site generator that takes its name from the great [Nikola Tesla](<a class="reference external" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla</a>), best known for his contributions to alternating current (AC), the electricity that powers everything we do.</p>
<p>Funnily enough though, I remember him best (the character, not the man) from the classic movie Prestige by Christopher Nolan (big fan!).</p>
<p>![ ](<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/62721000/jpg/_62721459_davidbowie_rex.jpg">http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/62721000/jpg/_62721459_davidbowie_rex.jpg</a>  &quot;A still from Prestige, source BBC&quot;)</p>
<p>Ok, so a natural first question to ask is, what is a static website?</p>
<p>In the words of Roberto Aslina, the creator of Nikola:
&gt;*In a static site, the whole site, every page, everything, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).*</p>
<p>So what is the difference between Nikola and a blogging platform like Wordpress? With Wordpress, the contents of your site live in a database known only to Wordpress and your blog is generated, in other words, converted to a presentation-ready HTML only when someone wants to see the page. Whereas with Nikola, the entire site lives in a folder on your laptop (or on Github if you maintain your source there) and is built and published, by you. The site is pre-built (you get to see it before anyone else does) and available once you deploy, whether or not someone wants to see the page. What's the benefit? Static websites will always load faster simply because it doesn't waste time re-building the site everytime.</p>
<p>That does it for me but Roberto below nicely illustrates more advantages:</p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#why-static](http://getnikola.com/handbook">http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#why-static](http://getnikola.com/handbook</a>.html#why-static)</p>
<p>Features
Nikola has some wonderful features, excerpt below from their [website](<a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com">https://getnikola.com</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Blogs, with tags, feeds, archives, comments, etc.</li>
<li>Themable</li>
<li>Fast builds, thanks to doit</li>
<li>Flexible, extensible via plugins</li>
<li>Small codebase (programmers can understand all of Nikola core in a day)</li>
<li>reStructuredText [Cheatsheet] or Markdown as input language (also Wiki, BBCode, Textile, AsciiDoc, Python Notebooks, Misaka, Pandoc, txt2tags, orgmode, and HTML)</li>
<li>Easy image galleries (just drop files in a folder!)</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting for almost any programming language or markup</li>
<li>Multilingual sites, translated to 18 languages.</li>
<li>Doesn't reinvent wheels, leverages existing tools.</li>
<li>Python 2 and 3 compatible.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me the killer feature is the <strong>IPython plugin</strong>, integrating the capabilities of IPython seamlessly with Nikola and makes blogging with IPython a snap. You can even go one step further and setup bi-directional communicaton between IPython and Nikola, as damien has shown [here](<a class="reference external" href="http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/bidirectional-ipython-nikola-workflow-to-write-your-blog-post.html">http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/bidirectional-ipython-nikola-workflow-to-write-your-blog-post.html</a>).</p>
<p>##A few words on Octopress
One of the reasons I started this blog is primarily to learn and share content related to Data Science, see my [About Page](<a class="reference external" href="https://shankarmsy.github.io/stories/about.html">https://shankarmsy.github.io/stories/about.html</a>) to learn more about me. When I began this quest, there was one thing I was sure of and that was hosting the site on Github. In case you're wondering, it's super easy to host a [page](<a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>) on Github (more on this later).</p>
<p>###Step in, Jekyll
Naturally, the first place I looked was Jekyll, a blog-aware static site generator for Github. As a matter of fact, Jekyll powers the Github pages. It works on the same lines of Nikola, using markdown syntax to render plain-old text files as HTML pages. Basically you type in a text file in Markdown syntax and it gets rendered as HTML. The catch? With Jekyll, you still have to write all your own HTML, CSS, etc. I am not sure I had the time to invest and learn through the process of hand-building my site. That's where Octopress came in handy!</p>
<p>###Hello Octopress
Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis and it's based on Jekyll. The difference, it takes care of HTML templates, CSS and so on for you. Similar to Nikola, it gives you more pre-built content that you can choose from and there are plenty of themes available to choose from. I tried and eventually succeeded in setting up a site based on Octopress, but two things turned me away:</p>
<p><strong>No Support for IPython</strong></p>
<p>This was the dealbreaker. I've chosen Python as my primary toolset for Data Science and my whole idea is to use IPython as the delivery mechanism to share my code snippets, learning/demonstrations etc. and I found no good way to convert the .ipynb notebooks to render well on an Octopress site. Even converting to HTML basic (without formatting) seemed to break the site somehow.</p>
<p>Jake Vanderplas explains the difficulties in configuring IPython for Octopress below:</p>
<p>[<a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/04/blogging-with-ipython/](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/04/blogging-with-ipython/">https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/04/blogging-with-ipython/](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/04/blogging-with-ipython/</a>)</p>
<p>Jake provided a workaround to achieve this but unfortunately I couldn't get it working. Moreover (with due respect to Jake) I really needed a more convenient solution if I am going to be doing this on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Octopress is based on Ruby</strong></p>
<p>Not that there is anything wrong with it, but I am a total Ruby noob and I found it a bit cumbersome to install and configure the environment. Also, it would make more sense to work in a Python based environment. I also found Octopress to be a tad slow compared to Nikola, but that's just my personal opinion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, take nothing away from Octopress, it still is a great way to static blog. Check out these sites to learn more if you're interested:</p>
<p>Octopress site has great documentation

<p>I found Chris Bernadski's blog to be an invaluable resource for installing Ruby with rbenv

<p>Let's get to it then. Here are the steps I followed to get my site functional with Nikola.</p>
<p>These instructions are for Linux, specifically Ubuntu but they should work for other distros as well. If you're not running Linux, you should definitely consider it (but that's for another day :-)</p>
<p>Before proceeding make sure you have Python
##Install Virtualenv</p>
